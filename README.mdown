Introduction
============

`geventirc` is a simple irc client library using gevent::

```python
from geventirc import Client

nick = 'geventircbot'
irc = Client('irc.freenode.net', nick,  port=6667)
irc.start()
irc.join()
```

Handlers
========

`handlers` react to messages from server, they can be any python
callable::

```python
from gevenirc import Client
from gevenirc import message
from gevenirc import handlers

def join_and_say_hello_handler(client, msg):
client.send_message(message.Join('#gevent'))
client.msg('#gevent', 'Hello #gevent guys!')


class ReplyWhenQuoted(object):
""" Reply when someone quotes me.
"""

commands = ['PRIVMSG']

def __init__(self, reply):
self.reply = reply

def __call__(self, client, msg):
channel, content = msg.params
if client.nick in content:
client.msg(self.reply)


def print_handler(self, client, msg):
""" Print every message from server to standard output.
"""
print msg.encode()[-2]

nick = 'geventircbot'
nickserv_handler = handlers.NickServHandler(nick, 'somepassword')

irc = Client('irc.freenode.net', nick,  port=6667)
# this handler doesn't provide a commands attribute nor specify at
# registration so it receives everything.
irc.add_handler(print_handler)
# 001 code means that you have successfully connected and can
# join channels.
irc.add_handler(join_and_say_hello_handler, '001')
# nickserv_handler has a commands attribute which tell which
# commands it's reacts to.
irc.add_handler(nickserv_handler)
irc.add_handler(ReplyWhenQuoted("I'm just a bot"))
irc.start()
irc.join() # join means join the current greenlet, not join irc channel
```
